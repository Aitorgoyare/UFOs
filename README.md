# UFOs

##Overview of the analysis:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
### Search Tool
![](https://github.com/Aitorgoyare/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Search.png)

To use the search tool, simply fill in all the fields for which you have information. You can fill in just one to have a broader search or all of them to have a more precise search.

The search criteria you have are:
Date
City
State
Country
Shape

## Summary:

One drawback of the page is that only its results are limited to the amount of information contained in the data file.

One recommendation would be that the site should have the ability to receive sightings data from other people so that the data contained on the site grows but only after it has gone through a checking process to verify the accuracy of the sightings.

Another recommendation would be to give the site the ability to display photographs of sightings. That would give users an enhanced user experience.
